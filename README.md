# employee-tracker
## Description
This is an application to manage a company's employee database. The goal is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

The repository is at https://github.com/sandy-06/employee-tracker.
The application will not be deployed so a video of the application will be used.

## Installation 
Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to interact with the user via the command line, and the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console.
You will need to run them in the console to run the project. You will need to run mysql2 and the schema and seed files.
